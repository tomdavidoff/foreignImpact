\title{Foreign Buyer Revisionism}

\section{Introduction}

Taxes and restrictions on foreign purchases of residences have been implemented
in multiple jurisdictions worldwide with the stated purpose of making homes
more affordable for domestic residents. For example, in extending a ban on
foreign purchases of Canadian residential real estate, a government press
release stated: ``For years, foreign money has been coming into Canada to buy
up residential real estate, increasing housing affordability concerns in cities
across the country, and particularly in major urban centres. Foreign ownership
has also fueled worries about Canadians being priced out of housing markets in
cities and towns across the country.''\footnote{\textcite{gOC}.}

There are theoretical and empirical reasons to expect foreign buyer taxes to
succeed in bringing down local housing prices, many of which are detailed in a
comprehensive study by \textcite{favilukisVanNieuwerburgh}. The disincentive to
purchase homes should reduce the number of buyers considering purchasing
properties and lower willigness to pay among remaining foreign buyers. This
reduction in prices hurts landlords and incumbent property owners through lost
property value and rents, but makes home ownership more affordable for locals
who do not yet own homes. There may be an associated loss of construction jobs,
and the analysis in \textcite{favilukisVanNieuwerburgh} does not consider the
effect of reciprocal taxes on domestic residents who may wish to purchase
property overseas.\footnote{It is not obvious that a target country would wish
	to reciprocate to disincentivize the host country's tax. For example,
	China, the source of most foreign buying in Canada prior to the recent
spate of taxes (per, e.g. \textcite{ctvNews}) has made efforts to discourage capital
flight.}

Existing studies of the impact of the entry and exit of foreign buyers on local home prices
present estimated effects that range from modest to quite large, as summarized
in \textcite{davidoffZheng}. \textcite{LiShenZhang},
\textcite{gorbackGlobalCapitalLocal2020}, \textcite{pavlovImmigrationFlows},
and \textcite{BadarinzaRamadorai} find that within metropolitan areas,
submarkets exposed to foreign buyers see larger price increases when the types
of foreign buyers prone to buy in those submarkets face increased incentives to
buy overseas. \textcite{DachisDurantonTurner}, \textcite{klevenBest},
\textcite{kopczukMunroe}, and \textcite{davidoffLeigh} find, as a general
matter, that increasing transaction taxes on housing purchases leads to fewer
transactions and lower prices. \textcite{HartleyForeign},
\textcite{andalfattoEstimatingEffectMetro2023}, \textcite{DuYinZhang}, and
\textcite{pavlovForeignBuyerTaxes} collectively find that foreign buyer taxes
in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand led to lower prices.

As \textcite{favilukisVanNieuwerburgh} observe, foreign buyers may not leave
homes empty, but rather rent them out to locals. In their calibration, this
changes the social welfare effect of foreign buyers from negative to slightly
positive. The effect of out of town buyers is moderate because local investors
are highly price sensitive in their demand for rental properties, and out-of-town
buyers represent a small share of overall capital investment. In this way,
foreign buyers represent a slightly positive form of capital accumulation. This
is a salient consideration, as British Columbia has imposed significant taxes on empty
homes and vacation properties in urban areas while also imposing significant
taxes on foreign buyers, and the Canadian federal government has both imposed
taxes on empty homes owned by foreigners and has temporarily banned the
purchase of single residences by foreigners.

At the time of writing, the market for condominiums in Vancouver and Toronto
are so weak that construction has stopped. While indicative of falling prices,
the lack of condo presales has led some observers to suggest that the taxation
of foreign buyers has overshot, leading to a negative supply response larger
than the positive demand response on prices from foreign buying, such that
locals have been adversely affected. It is thus worthwhile asking whether there
is empirical evidence supporting the idea that foreign buyers, particularly in
the presence of empty homes taxes, may have positive welfare effects and their
taxation adverse effects on housing affordability for locals. QUOTE GOODMAND AND RENNIE HERE

There are several channels through which foreign buyers could have positive
affordability effects. First, per \textcite{favilukisVanNieuwerburgh}, foreign
buyers may rent houses to locals, particularly in the presence of an empty
homes tax.\footnote{This observation is echoed in the BC context in a policy
brief, \textcite{Goodman}.} Second, foreign buyers may purchase condominiums in
the presale phase of condominium development and then assign their contracts
prior to completion. The presence of foreign presale purchasers would raise
presale prices, encouraging the supply of condominiums, but with no increase in
demand for occupied space. The net effect of that form of investment should be
positive for affordability for end users, with an adverse competition effect
for locals who wish to occupy homes purchased through the presale channel.

A third way in which foreign buyers could have a beneficial effect on
housing affordability for local apartment buyers if they have a relative
preference for quality, and if there is a high degree of vertical
differentiation within buildings. In that case, foreign buyers could make
projects more profitable than they would otherwise be, increasing supply, but
without crowding out local demand. This would be a variant of the positive
``pecuniary externality''

In the next sections, we review some available economic evidence on the extent to which 
the channels alluded to above are operative in the Vancouver housing market.

\section{Stock and flow of foreign purchases in Greater Vancouver}

For the years starting in 2018, the Canadian Housing Statistics Program has used its access to ownership data on the universe of Canadian residences to publish statistics on ownership by residency status in Canada. This is an approximation of foreign ownership, because some owners who live overseas are Canadian citizens or permanent residents, and hence exempt from foreign buyer taxes. Also, some Canadian residents are not yet landed immigrants, and hence are subject to the foreign buyer tax. Thus CHSP represents an approximation of the stock of ``foreign'' ownership over time. Unfortunately, the stock measure is not readily available prior to 2018. Between 2018 and 2022, the number of non-resident owners in the Vancouver Census Metropolitan Area grew from 24,135 to 26,350, but fell from 9.6\% to 9.0\%.

The apparent declining stock of foreign ownership as a share of all residences
is matched by a declining share of the flow into ownership. The B.C. provincial
government started collecting data on the nationality of residential property
buyers shortly before implementing the additional property transfer tax of 15\%
on foreign buyers in mid-2016. In the month (July) prior to implementation,
15\% of purchases in Metro Vancouver involved foreign participation. For the
years since, the fractions have been as shown in Table \ref{tab:fbt}. COVID and
the national foreign buyer ban have likely contributed to the decline over time
in foreign participation.

\section{Do foreign buyers leave homes empty?}

In the presence of an empty homes tax, foreign owners who retain their
properties most commonly rent them out. Per \textcite{specTax2019}, of 3,709
foreign owners deemed subject to the empty homes tax in 2018, 1,205
transitioned to renting their homes out in 2019, 1,413 sold their property, 951
remained subject to the tax, and only 66 transitioned to using the home as a
primary residence. 

\section{Do foreign buyers specialize in the most luxurious units within buildings?}

Consider a limiting case, in which foreign buyers demand a high level of quality, and local buyers are indifferent between low- and high-quality apartments. First suppose apartment buildings can be built at a constant cost of \$$c$ per sdquare foot, and that builders will build infinitely many so long as the price they can charge per square foot is greater than $c$. so that Suppose that foreign buyers will only purchase penthouse apartments, and are willing to pay $p_{f}$ for a penthouse unit. Local buyers, are willing to pay a price of $x$
To see this channel, consider a limiting case
in which top-floor penthouse units have a high level of quality, and all homes
below the penthouse have a lower level of quality. For simplicity, assume all
buildings are 10 storeys tall. If steady state construction supply is
infinitely elastic at a price of \$X, then if foreign investors are permitted
in a market, then the price to locals will be:

\begin{align}
	.9p_{l}(q) + .1p_{f} = X\\
	p_{l} = \frac{X - .1p_{f}}{.9}.
\end{align}

Without foreign buyers, the price of lower-quality units would be $p_{l} =
\frac{X-.1p_{d}}{.9}$. In that way, luxury foreign demand could crowd out local
luxury demand, but subsidize local consumption of generic units.

Figure \ref{fig:variance_decomposition} presents suggestive evidence on the question of
whether foreign buyers may offer implicit subsidies to local buyers of
standard-quality units through abnormally high willingness to pay for higher
quality units, for example, those with prime views. The data are taken from
condominium resales in Greater Vancouver between 2010 and 2023, with data
provided by BC Assessment. The plot measures the year of transactions on the
horizontal axis. On the vertical axis are measures of the variance of the
natural logarithm of transaction prices by year. The red line plots the
variance of all transaction prices. The green plots the variance of mean prices
across buildings.\footnote{If there were only one transaction for each building
with a transaction in a given year, the red and green lines would coincide.}
The blue line plots the mean variance of log transaction prices within
buildings. 

The dashed vertical line in Figure \ref{fig:variance_decomposition} coincides
with the imposition of the foreign buyer tax in July, 2016. Consistent with
foreign buyers demanding more expensive units [CITE], the overall variance of
prices drops sharply in the years after the tax, consistent with loss of an important luxury
segment of the market. However, the reduction in price variance appears to be
almost entirely driven by
